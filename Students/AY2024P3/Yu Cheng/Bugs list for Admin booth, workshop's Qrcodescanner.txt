1. Qrcodescanner dialogue message pop-up (if missed out the successful message, it will cause confusion)

- The successful message shown sometimes will quickly switch another message named: Visitor ticket has already been stamped for this booth.

- ^ this will cause a confusion to the boothadmin because if they missed out looking at the successful message, they will be misled into thinking that the Visitor already scanned the booth (twice).
