Current bugs/issues:
 - Some part of the code or AWS side may be causing lag where the websocket message isn't sent to the page, so a temp fix is made by adding a 5 second delay after the formSG is uploaded and another 5 second delay after receiving the "UPDATE_IMAGE" message before triggering the function.
 - The map in the wayfinder isn't fully updated yet.
 - There may be some timeout issues if the user comes back with the same ticketID after a few days.
